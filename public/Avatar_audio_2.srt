Creating courses that truly engage

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,961
students is hard. Static slides and long

3
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:07,922
videos just don't cut it anymore. That's

4
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:10,003
why educators are switching to Encrypt,

5
00:00:10,323 --> 00:00:12,564

6
00:00:12,564 --> 00:00:14,965
slides into interactive avatar-guided

00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:17,765
lessons. Here's why they love it. With

00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,528
diagram, a formula, or a key point,

11
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:28,249
and instantly hear a friendly avatar

12
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:31,209
explain it in detail. This interactivity

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,770
